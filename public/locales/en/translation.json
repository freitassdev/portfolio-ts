I'm studying Systems Development at Etec Jaraguá and I also work as a Web Developer intern at Focus Têxtil. I work on both front-end and back-end, using main Node.js technologies (such as React, Express, Nest, and a little bit of Angular) and also in mobile programming, using React Native with TypeScript. For now, I'm studying a bit of C# (or CSharp for the closest ones) and MySQL.",
                "part2": "Breaking a bit from this internship and study routine, I usually play video games and volleyball, listen to music, and watch movies and series (who doesn't like a movie, right? rsrs). Besides, I enjoy traveling, developing some projects, and walking around the city. I'm excited to keep exploring the world of technology and eager to collaborate on innovative projects. Let's build something amazing together!"
